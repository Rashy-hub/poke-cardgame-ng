# PokeCardGame

This project is my first small project in Angular. It is a card game based on the Pok√©mon universe. The goal of this project is for me to learn solid **Angular** fundamentals.  
This project is based on a tutorial by **simpletech** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U71TQN68QGU). I adapted their backend REST API using Django and deployed it in a web service on Render.
Backend docs : (https://playing-cards-backend.onrender.com/api/swagger-ui/)
